sswg-mvm; version 1.0+ (living document)
Date: 05-03-2025
Document title: Community & Collaboration Guide
Author: Tommy Raven
Licensing: Raven Recordings ©️ see: *LICENSE.md*
(Document) Purpose: Outline how contributors collaborate around the SSWG-MVM, including contribution etiquette, communication channels, and onboarding steps. Reinforce that SSWG is the topic base multiplier that guides recursive work. Link newcomers to the root [README](../README.md) and [docs/README.md](./README.md) for deeper system context.

# Community & Collaboration Guide — SSWG-MVM

## Overview

**SSWG-MVM** encourages collaboration, learning, and shared development of AI instructional workflows. This document outlines community expectations, contribution paths, and communication channels.

---

## Getting Started

* **Explore the repository** — Review `README.md`, `docs/`, and example workflows in `data/templates/`.
* **Clone the repo** — `git clone https://github.com/Tommy-Raven/sswg-mvm1.0.git`
* **Install dependencies** — `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* **Run tests** — `pytest tests/` to ensure your environment is working.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

* Submit bug reports or feature requests via GitHub Issues.
* Fork the repository for development; create a feature branch for your changes.
* Follow the phase-based workflow structure when adding modules or templates.
* Ensure any new workflows are validated against JSON schemas (`schemas/`).
* Include unit tests for all new functionality in `tests/`.
* Pull Requests should reference the issue, provide a clear description, and pass CI checks.

---

## Code of Conduct

* Respect all community members.
* Keep discussions focused on ideas and solutions.
* Avoid sharing sensitive information or proprietary content.
* Follow best practices for secure AI development.

---

## Communication Channels

* **GitHub Issues & Pull Requests** — Primary discussion and contribution forum.
* **Docs & Wiki** — Reference `docs/` for architecture, API, and SSWG-guided recursive workflow guides.
* **Discussions / Q&A** — Use GitHub Discussions for brainstorming and non-urgent questions.

---

## Onboarding Highlights

* Each module is designed for clarity: initialization → refinement → generation → evaluation → regeneration.
* Recursive outputs teach subsequent workflows, creating an evolving knowledge base anchored on SSWG.
* JSON and Markdown outputs are human- and machine-readable.
* Use `generator/main.py` or FastAPI endpoints to explore SSWG-guided recursive workflow creation.

## 🔬 Cognitive Optimization Research

The community welcomes contributors who want to explore bounded cognition, entropy governance, and verity metrics. If you are working on optimization telemetry, ontology alignment, or evaluation theory, open an issue or discussion labeled **cognitive-optimization** to coordinate research efforts.
