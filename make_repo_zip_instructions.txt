Repository zip packaging (current workflow)

1. Ensure the working tree is clean and that required validation has run:
   - `python -m generator.pdl_validator pdl/example_full_9_phase.yaml schemas`
   - `make gates` (optional for audit readiness)

2. Create a source archive from the current commit:
   - `git archive --format=zip --output sswg-mvm-$(date +%Y%m%d).zip HEAD`

3. (Optional) Build an audit evidence bundle for compliance review:
   - `python scripts/audit_bundle_builder.py --run-id audit-$(date +%Y%m%d)`

4. Store the zip alongside the audit manifest under `artifacts/` if the
   distribution requires audit evidence.
