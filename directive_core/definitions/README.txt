DIRECTORY STATUS: INTENTIONALLY EMPTY

This directory is intentionally empty to prevent legacy definition artifacts from creating implicit or competing authority surfaces.

MIGRATION NOTICE
Legacy definitions previously stored under directive_core/definitions/ have been migrated to TOML governance artifacts under:
directive_core/docs/

QUARANTINE REFERENCE
Legacy definition artifacts have been quarantined at:
data/quarantine/legacy_definitions/

AUTHORITY NOTE
README.txt is non-authoritative and exists only for traceability and audit context. TOML governance under directive_core/docs/ is the authoritative control plane.
