      produced by a deterministic process.

  - id: bijective_identifiers
    rule: >
      Identifiers used for labeling must be unique, gap-free, and reproducible.

  - id: artifacts_not_canonical
    rule: >
      Generated artifacts must not redefine or overwrite canonical structures.

  - id: validation_required
    rule: >
