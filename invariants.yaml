invariants:
  - id: deterministic_measurement
    rule: >
      Any output used for measurement, indexing, or comparison must be
      produced by a deterministic process.

  - id: bijective_identifiers
    rule: >
      Identifiers used for labeling must be unique, gap-free, and reproducible.

  - id: artifacts_not_canonical
    rule: >
      Generated artifacts must not redefine or overwrite canonical structures.

  - id: validation_required
    rule: >
      Outputs that fail validation must not be promoted or reused.

  - id: quarantine_on_failure
    rule: >
      Workflows with critical or major incidents must remain quarantined
      until recovery steps complete and validation passes.
