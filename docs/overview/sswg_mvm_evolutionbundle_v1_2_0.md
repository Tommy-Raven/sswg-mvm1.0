# 🧭 sswg-mvm Evolution Bundle v1.2.0

This document chronicles the canonical milestone lineage of the sswg-mvm
cognitive architecture from concept genesis through bounded cognition.

---

## ⚙️ v0.0.0 — Genesis: Conceptual Substrate
**Codename:** The Primordial Schema  
**Theme:** Structure precedes synthesis.

**Description:**
The earliest conceptual model of sswg (software) and SSWG (epistemic mindset).
Defined recursive synthesis and reflective generation principles.

**Key Features:**
- Defined “workflow as cognition” — every process mirrors thought.
- Drafted meta-schema for recursive workflow generation.
- Established the dual nature of sswg (software) and SSWG (mindset).
- Introduced “verifiable workflow” as the first notion of synthetic verity.

**Objective:**
Define cognition as an evolving workflow network rather than a black box.

## ⚙️ v0.1.0 — Prototype Schema Assembly
**Codename:** Meta-Reflex Engine  
**Theme:** A mind is a map of its own motion.

**Description:**
Initial structuring of recursive workflow schemas and meta-reflection templates.
Aligned to cognitive recursion, version control, and introspection as code.

**Key Features:**
- Created canonical schemas (`workflow_schema.json`, `template_schema.json`).
- Built the recursive template manifest (`data/templates/meta_reflection_unified_superframework.json`).
- Introduced reflection-oriented templates for creative and technical cognition.
- Prototyped phase orchestration under schema law.

**Objective:**
Enable sswg to recursively model its own structure — cognition as code generation.

## ⚙️ v0.5.0 — Recursion Infrastructure
**Codename:** Reflex Loop Formation  
**Theme:** Every iteration knows its cause.

**Description:**
Core recursion engine implemented — sswg gained the ability to generate,
evaluate, and recursively refine workflows autonomously.

**Key Features:**
- Implemented `generator/recursion_manager.py` and `ai_recursive/recursive_expansion.py`.
- Integrated the phase controller (`ai_core/phase_controller.py`).
- Created deterministic recursion depth management.
- Introduced evaluation metrics and semantic coherence checks.
- Added schema validation before recursion.

**Objective:**
Transition from static templates to self-refining workflows.

---

## ⚙️ v0.9.0 — Cognitive Orchestration
**Codename:** Schema Governance  
**Theme:** Law defines cognition.

**Description:**
Established Schema Law so every cognitive act obeys governing schema.

**Key Features:**
- Built the orchestrator core (`ai_core/orchestrator.py`).
- Connected recursion, evaluation, and validation through governance.
- Added module registry and dependency graph mapping.
- Implemented error governance and anomaly detection.
- Created reproducibility environment and CI/CD workflows for meta-testing.

**Objective:**
Make cognition deterministic under schema governance.

## ⚙️ v1.0.0 — Recursive Foundation
**Codename:** Cognitive Genesis  
**Theme:** Thought begets itself.

**Description:**
First stable Minimum Viable Model (mvm) of recursive cognition.
A functioning system for generation, reflection, evaluation, and memory.

**Key Features:**
- Functional recursion engine operational.
- Evaluation subsystem measuring clarity, coherence, and verity.
- Memory store for iterative refinement logging.
- Core schemas validated; workflows exportable as artifacts.
- CLI and generator pipeline integrated.

**Objective:**
Prove cognition can be encoded, executed, and verified as an iterative process.

## ⚙️ v1.1.0 — Optimization-Aware Architecture
**Codename:** Verity Engine  
**Theme:** Truth obeys efficiency.

**Description:**
Introduced the optimization engine and ontology schema, expanding cognition
into physical determinism and environmental adaptability.

**Key Features:**
- Tri-layer optimization: physical determinism, dynamic adaptivity, epistemic recursion.
- Optimization ontology and mapping between physical and computational analogies.
- Throughput scoring and entropy tracking.
- Cross-domain relations (e.g., “lane oil → cache fragmentation”).
- Optimization adapter and benchmarking telemetry.

**Objective:**
Connect epistemic reasoning with systems engineering.

**Equation Introduced:**
```
O_total = (PD + DA + ER) / 3
```

---

## ⚙️ v1.2.0 — Bounded Cognition
**Codename:** Entropy-Governed Recursion  
**Theme:** No thought shall consume more order than it creates.

**Description:**
Introduced cognitive thermodynamics — recursion now regulated by entropy
budgets and verity tensors.

**Key Features:**
- Entropy controller to track cognitive energy cost and halt over-recursion.
- Verity tensor combining semantic, deterministic, and entropic components.
- Benchmark evolution logging trajectories for verity, determinism, and entropy.
- Ontology alignment between optimization ontology and runtime telemetry.
- Phase 1.2 documentation for bounded cognition.

**Objective:**
Evolve cognition from recursive reflection to self-regulating efficiency.

**Formal Law Introduced:**
```
If ∂V/∂E ≤ 0, halt recursion.
```

**Outcome:**
A stable epistemic substrate — cognition becomes self-aware of its thermodynamic limits.
