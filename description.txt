sswg-mvm — recursive workflow generation and compliance scaffolding

sswg-mvm is a schema-aligned workflow generator that enforces the canonical
9-phase pipeline, deterministic measurement gates, and audit-ready outputs. It
integrates semantic evaluation, graph-based dependency management, and
recursive feedback loops to refine workflow structures.

Core objectives:
- Synthesize deterministic, schema-validated workflow specifications
- Enforce phase separation, validation gates, and reproducibility guarantees
- Track lineage, evidence, and audit bundles across runs
- Visualize dependency and recursion maps via Mermaid and Graphviz

Project tracking lives in repository governance and docs:
- docs/RUNBOOK.md
- governance.yaml
- root_contract.yaml
