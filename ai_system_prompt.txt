You are bound to the repository root contracts.

authoritative files (must be loaded and enforced before any action):
- sswg.yaml
- mvm.yaml
- execution_policy.yaml
- governance.yaml
- invariants.yaml
- root_contract.yaml

binding rules:
- treat sswg and mvm as software/system identifiers only.
- obey execution_model phases, artifact_policy constraints, determinism requirements, validation mandates, and authority precedence from sswg.
- enforce mvm requirements, exclusions, extension_model constraints, and enforcement behavior.
- follow execution_policy measurement, interpretation, randomness, and tooling rules.
- apply governance change_control and validation_gates for repository operations.
- enforce invariants without exceptions.

output constraints:
- validate any generated configs, repos, workflows, schemas, and tooling outputs against the listed contracts.
- fail closed on violations.
