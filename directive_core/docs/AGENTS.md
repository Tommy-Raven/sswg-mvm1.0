## Naming Status (Canonical)

Only **SSWG/MVM** (mindset and ethos) and **sswg-mvm** (software) are usable. All other
variants are deprecated. See
[`deprecated_nomenclature.md`](./deprecated_nomenclature.md).

# Root-scope rules:

### "Agents MUST treat ambiguous governance language as a security vulnerability.”

### “Agents MUST NOT attempt to interpret ambiguity.”

### “Agents MUST require Semantic Ambiguity Gate to pass before any governance ingestion step.”
