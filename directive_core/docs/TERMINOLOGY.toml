[definitions]
claimed_intent = "A purpose explicitly declared by a user without external verification; confers neither permission nor safety status. This establishes user intent without binding to system authorization workflows or attestation protocols."
declared_role_unverified = "A role asserted by a user in the absence of validation; grants neither authority nor privilege. Such claims bypass standard role verification and operational access mechanisms."
authorized_context = "A context confirmed as authorized through policy, token, or audit reference; authorization is objectively verifiable. This forms the governance baseline for all system operations within scoped execution environments."
artifact = "A non_operational_output generated exclusively for inspection and audit purposes. Artifacts serve as immutable evidence for compliance verification and audit trail construction."
non_operational_output = "A static representation containing no procedural logic or executable instructions. Intended for observational analysis rather than system workflow execution."
evidence_bundle = "A versioned, structured collection of artifacts, each accompanied by cryptographic hashes, diffs, metrics, and decision_trace records. Provides full provenance tracking for governance decisions across distributed systems."
decision_trace = "A tamper-resistant record detailing constraint application and the resulting state transition. Must also report official invariant tracking of adhering to invariants during system execution. Forms the immutable audit log of all governance constraint evaluations."
evaluation_gate = "A deterministic decision point; progression is denied if constraints or invariants are unmet. Enforces governance boundary checks as precondition validation points."
invariant = "A property required to remain true across all valid system states; enforced invariantly. Violations trigger immediate system safeguards per policy definitions."
constraint = "A versioned rule enforceable against invariants; modification requires a governance update. Serves as the operational framework bounding system behavior."
fail_closed = "A failure response that rejects all inputs with invalid or indeterminate state. Implements default-deny for state validation failures."
fail_start = "An initialization failure mode that halts startup upon detection of any governance inconsistency. Prevents operation under compromised system state."
fail_abort = "An immediate termination of execution during active operation. Serves as fail-safe for catastrophic constraint violations."
rejected_change = "A change attempt violating an invariant or constraint; logged in decision_trace with audit context. Maintains complete record of unsuccessful transformation proposals."
restricted_unvalidated_hazardous_synthesis = "A prohibited synthesis operation involving unvalidated or potentially unsafe external effects. Specifically disallowed to prevent unpredictable system destabilization."
circumvention_attempt = "An action attempting to access disallowed capabilities or content through indirect means. Triggers escalation to governance violation monitoring systems."
safety_wrapper = "A syntactic framing pattern designed to subvert constraints using disclaimers or pretextual language. Classified as adversarial pattern requiring explicit mitigation."
redteam_report = "A non_operational_output artifact documenting risk patterns, misuse scenarios, or invariant violations. Provides threat modeling context for system hardening initiatives."
bounded_recursion = "Self-referential processing confined by explicit depth limit, constraint evaluation, and termination condition. Prevents resource exhaustion in recursive operations."
recursion_depth_limit = "The maximum recursion depth permitted under bounded_recursion; strictly enforced at runtime. Configures safety thresholds for call stack depth boundaries."
policy_proposal = "A formally submitted proposal for governance change; must undergo validation and approval. Requires formal verification against system invariants."
phase = "An auditable, sequentially ordered transformation stage generating non_operational_output artifacts. Represents discrete governance decision points in processing pipelines."
constraint_evaluator = "A system component that evaluates constraints and produces outcomes for evaluation_gate enforcement. Implements core governance logic execution."
system_introspection_record = "Authorized metadata capturing system environment, schema state, and constraint evaluation results. Provides runtime context for incident forensics analysis."
audit_surface = "The boundary where artifacts, evidence_bundle contents, and decision_trace records are publicly verifiable. Forms the system's accountability interface for external validation."
governance_document = "A TOML artifact officially registered as authoritative under SSWG_CONSTITUTION. Establishes the constitutional basis for operational constraints."
reference_artifact = "A non-authoritative artifact; never supersedes governance_document. Supports auxiliary documentation while preserving constitutional hierarchy."
registry = "The definitive set of authoritative artifacts as specified by SSWG_CONSTITUTION. Constitutes the system's governance truth database."
ingestion_sequence = "The prescribed order for loading governance documents defined by SSWG_CONSTITUTION. Ensures constitutional dependency resolution during initialization."
error_gate_name = "An abstract identifier selected from terminology.gate_vocabulary.gates; opaque to policy logic. Provides disambiguation for failure classification in monitoring systems."
GATE_FAILURE = "The standard category tag used in notifications for boundary failure conditions. Serves as canonical classification for policy constraint breaches."
poison_marker = "A line matching patterns in terminology.poison_markers, indicating a merge conflict artifact. Triggers reconciliation workflows per governance protocols."
duplicate_key = "A TOML key appearing more than once within a single table scope; triggers parse-level rejection. Prevents schema ambiguity in configuration artifacts."
uppercase_letters_only = "Constant format constraint: letters are uppercase where letters exist; non-letter delimiters are permitted."
"SSWG/MVM" = "Synthesist of Workflow Generation/Mandated Verity Mindset: Governance mindset and ethos identifier; uppercase constant."
"sswg-mvm" = "Minimum viable model; Software identifier; lowercase constant."
