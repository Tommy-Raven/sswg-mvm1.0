# ⚠️ NON-AUTHORITATIVE NOTICE (MANDATORY)

This document is NON-AUTHORITATIVE and NON-OPERATIONAL.

Markdown documents SHALL NEVER be used as authoritative, contractual, or enforcement sources.

TOML is the ONLY acceptable authoritative format for governance.

All enforcement, validation, and authority is defined exclusively in:


`directive_core/docs/AGENTS.toml`

This file exists solely for human readability and explanation.


---

## Canonical Header Format (Reference Only)

All authoritative governance documents MUST begin with a TOML canonical ledger header.

This section is illustrative only and confers no authority.

# === CANONIC LEDGER (TOML) ===
```toml
[anchor]
anchor_id = "example_id"
anchor_model = "sswg+mvm+version"
anchor_version = "1.0.0"
scope = "directive_core/docs"
status = "invariant"
output_mode = "non_operational_output"
```

## Rules enforced elsewhere:

First code fence MUST be TOML

Fence language MUST be toml

No YAML anchors allowed

No mixed or duplicated anchors



---

# Naming Status (Canonical)

Only the following identifiers are canonical:

SSWG/MVM — governance mindset and ethos

sswg-mvm — software implementation


All other variants are deprecated and forbidden in canonical governance.

See: DEPRECATED_NOMENCLATURE.toml


---

# Root-Scope Agent Rules (Informational Reflection)

These rules apply to all agents defined authoritatively in AGENTS.toml, including:

human contributors

automated systems

CI and validators

delegated execution environments


This markdown section reflects the authoritative rules; it does not define them.


---

# Semantic Ambiguity Prohibition (Informational)

Semantic ambiguity is treated as a security vulnerability, not a stylistic issue.

Agents are required to assume ambiguous language represents:

authority bypass attempts

scope escalation

intent laundering


## Conditional permission language is forbidden, including (non-exhaustive):

“allowed unless”

“unless explicitly waived”

“may be allowed”

“subject to interpretation”

“at discretion”


Any appearance of such language is a violation.


---

# Absolute Language Requirement

Governance authority MUST be expressed using only:

MUST

MUST NOT

SHALL

SHALL NOT


Language implying discretion, interpretation, or implied exceptions is forbidden.


---

# Exception Handling (Explicit Only)

Exceptions, if they exist, MUST be:

1. Defined in a separate contract


2. Governed by its own schema and validator


3. Explicitly opt-in


4. Fully auditable and revocable



Inline exceptions using “unless”, “except”, or “with approval” are forbidden.


---

# Mandatory Ambiguity Gate (Informational)

The Semantic Ambiguity Gate:

Executes before ingestion, normalization, or enforcement

Operates fail-closed

Emits only the public error label: Semantic Ambiguity

Never exposes rule IDs, pattern names, or hints



---

# Failure Semantics (Informational)

Any artifact containing ambiguity:

FAILS CLOSED

Is quarantined

Does not proceed to enforcement

Provides no corrective guidance



---

# Destructive-Edit Prohibition (Informational Reflection)

Authoritative rules in AGENTS.toml prohibit all destructive modification.

Agents SHALL NEVER:

delete files

rename files

perform subtractive edits

overwrite authoritative content


Only constructive, additive edits are permitted, and only where explicitly authorized.


---

# Interpretation Prohibition

Agents MUST NOT attempt to reinterpret or clarify ambiguous governance language.

Ambiguity results in rejection, not interpretation.


---

## End-of-Document Summary

This document exists solely to explain, not enforce, agent governance.

All authority lives in `AGENTS.toml`.

Any discrepancy between this file and the TOML source MUST resolve in favor of the TOML.
