# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming, safe, and professional environment
for everyone participating in the sswg/mvm project, regardless of background,
identity, or experience.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Treating others with respect, empathy, and professionalism.
- Communicating thoughtfully, especially during reviews and governance
  discussions.
- Respecting the repository's deterministic pipeline requirements and
  compliance gates.
- Following canonical anchor, overlay, and validation rules as defined in
  AGENTS.md, governance.yaml, sswg.yaml, and mvm.yaml.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Publishing confidential or sensitive information without authorization.
- Bypassing required validation gates or altering canonical artifacts without
  approved overlays.
- Introducing nondeterminism into phases that require determinism.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all repository spaces (issues, discussions,
code reviews, documentation, and community communications).

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it via a
GitHub issue labeled `conduct` unless the report is sensitive. For sensitive
reports, follow the private reporting flow described in SECURITY.md.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers will investigate reports, apply corrective actions, and
coordinate outcomes consistent with repository governance and compliance
requirements.

## Research Integrity

Developers must maintain verity-first design ethics — no optimization shall reduce epistemic integrity.
