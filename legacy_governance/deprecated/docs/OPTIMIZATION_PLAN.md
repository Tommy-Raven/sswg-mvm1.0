sswg-mvm; version 1.0+ (living document)
Date: 05-03-2025
Document title: Optimization & System Evolution Plan
Author: Tommy Raven
Licensing: Raven Recordings ©️ see: *LICENSE.md*
(Document) Purpose: Outline planned and in-flight optimizations for the SSWG-MVM, mapping each initiative to the modular phases described in the root [README](../README.md) and [docs/README.md](./README.md). Keep the focus on SSWG as the topic base multiplier while refining performance, stability, and observability. Provide a quick reference to track status, priorities, and supporting modules.

# Optimization & System Evolution Plan

This document tracks ongoing optimization efforts and system evolution for the **SSWG-MVM**, aligned with phase-based workflow execution and recursive improvements.

| Phase                             | Focus Area                                | Description                                                                                                                 | Status         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **1 — Core Stability**            | Exception Handling & RecursionManager     | Prevent infinite loops, improve runtime safety, and ensure deterministic execution across all workflows.                    | 🟢 In Progress |
| **2 — Semantic Intelligence**     | Semantic Delta Scoring                    | Enable intelligent recursion termination when output stabilization is detected.                                             | 🟡 Planned     |
| **3 — Performance Optimization**  | Caching, GC Triggers, & Memory Efficiency | Reduce runtime and RAM overhead; reuse modules where possible and monitor memory usage via `benchmark_tracker.py`.          | 🟡 Planned     |
| **4 — Scalability**               | Async / Multithreaded Execution           | Parallelize workflow generation for multiple independent workflows; improve throughput and phase-level concurrency.         | 🟡 Planned     |
| **5 — Monitoring & Telemetry**    | Structured Logs & Metrics                 | Capture recursion runtime, semantic stability, cache hits, and phase completion times for adaptive optimization.            | 🟡 Planned     |
| **6 — Validation**                | Regression & Schema Tracking              | Ensure version compatibility, validate against JSON schemas, and automatically detect contradictions or inconsistencies.    | 🟡 Planned     |
| **7 — Visualization**             | Graphviz / Mermaid Integration            | Auto-generate workflow diagrams for each phase, including recursive evolution and lineage mapping.                          | 🟡 Planned     |
| **8 — Adaptive Learning**         | Memory Persistence & Analytics            | Enable workflows to “learn” from prior runs using `ai_memory` analytics; track trends for continuous improvement.           | 🟡 Planned     |
| **9 — Evaluation Efficiency**     | Optimized Metric Calculations             | Reduce evaluation overhead by caching intermediate scoring results for clarity, expandability, and translatability metrics. | 🟡 Planned     |
| **10 — Integration & Deployment** | FastAPI Endpoints & CLI Refinements       | Ensure smooth deployment, consistent API behavior, and easy onboarding for developers and end-users.                        | 🟡 Planned     |

## Key Principles

* **Phase-Based Optimizations:** Improvements are applied per workflow phase to target bottlenecks and maintain modularity.
* **Recursive-Aware Design:** Enhancements consider self-evolving workflows and semantic stabilization.
* **Traceable Metrics:** All optimizations are measurable via memory, runtime, cache utilization, and semantic stability.
* **Adaptive & Iterative:** The system learns from previous executions to guide future recursion and module reuse.
