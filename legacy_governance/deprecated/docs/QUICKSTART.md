# Quickstart Guide — SSWG-MVM

Welcome to **SSWG-MVM (Synthetic Synthesist of Workflow Generation — Minimum Viable Model)**.

This system generates, evaluates, and recursively evolves instructional workflows, producing both **human-readable** and **machine-readable** outputs. It is designed for reproducibility, extensibility, and research-grade inspection.

This Quickstart is intentionally minimal: it gets you from clone → first run → understanding recursion.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Canonical run guide:** [docs/RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md)

### 1. Clone the Canonical Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tommy-Raven/SSWG-mvm1.0.git
cd SSWG-mvm1.0
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using pip:

```bash
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

For fully reproducible environments, see:
- `reproducibility/`
- `docker/Dockerfile`

---

### 3. Run the Canonical PDL Entry Point

```bash
python3 generator/main.py --pdl pdl/default-pdf.yaml --demo
```

This executes the runtime-driven PDL pipeline:
- PDL schema validation + handler resolution
- canonical 9-phase execution
- PDL run report emission

---

### 4. Trigger Recursive Refinement (Optional)

When prompted during execution, choose the option to **refine or expand** the workflow.

Recursive execution will:
- generate variant workflows,
- evaluate semantic and quality deltas,
- select or merge improved results,
- record metrics and lineage.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Git
- Optional but recommended:
  - Docker (containerized execution)
  - VS Code or compatible editor

---

## 📂 Outputs

The system produces:

- Human-readable artifacts:
  - Markdown (`.md`)
- Machine-readable artifacts:
  - JSON (`.json`)

All generated outputs, diagrams, metrics, and history snapshots are written to:

```
data/outputs/demo_run/
```

Artifacts are additive-only and versioned for traceability.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Reference

For a complete, code-aligned system description, see:

```
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

This document defines:
- subsystem responsibilities,
- recursion and feedback loops,
- evaluation metrics,
- demo pipeline structure,
- and governance invariants.

Canonical invariants (including schema validation invariants) are defined in [invariants.yaml](../invariants.yaml) and detailed in [root_contract.yaml](../root_contract.yaml).

## 🔁 Canonical 9-Phase Flow

The MVM pipeline follows the canonical 9-phase flow:

1. ingest
2. normalize
3. parse
4. analyze
5. generate
6. validate
7. compare
8. interpret
9. log

Exact execution order and responsibilities are defined in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## 🧪 Tests

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest -q tests
```

---

## ⚡ Tips

- Use `generator/main.py` for local CLI execution.
- Recursive runs improve clarity and reduce redundancy over iterations.
- All outputs are versioned; inspect diffs to understand evolution.
- Metrics and feedback guide recursion decisions.

---

This Quickstart provides everything needed to generate your first workflow, inspect its evaluation, and optionally explore recursive self-improvement.
