# Workflow workflow_001

## Objective
Refined: Teach AI to generate recursive workflows with measurable sub-objectives

## Stages
### Stage 1 – Gather Inputs
- Step 1 – Collect purpose
- Step 2 – Collect audience
- Step 3 – Collect constraints

### Stage 2 – Generate Workflow Skeleton
- Step 1 – Outline phases
- Step 2 – Map submodules

### Stage 3 – Write Step-by-Step Guide
- Step 1 – Human-readable instructions
- Step 2 – Include examples

### Stage 4 – Evaluation Prep
- Step 1 – Prepare evaluation criteria

## Modules
{"Stage 1 – Gather Inputs": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"], "Stage 2 – Generate Workflow Skeleton": ["Step 1", "Step 2"], "Stage 3 – Write Step-by-Step Guide": ["Step 1", "Step 2"], "Stage 4 – Evaluation Prep": ["Step 1"]}

## Dependencies
- Stage 1 feeds Stage 2
- Stage 2 feeds Stage 3

## Evaluation Report
- Clarity: good
- Coverage: complete
- Expandability: modular
- Translatability: AI-readable

## Next Steps
Improved workflow based on evaluation report, ready for recursive expansion
