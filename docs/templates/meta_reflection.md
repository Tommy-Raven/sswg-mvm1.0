# 🌒 Phase Overview

## **P1 — Awareness & Observation**
Collect raw evidence of performance.

Tasks:
- Gather system outputs  
- Identify recurring success/error patterns  
- Document cognitive or procedural biases  

---

## **P2 — Interpretation & Reconciliation**
Make meaning from observed patterns.

Tasks:
- Map trends to underlying causes  
- Compare actual outcomes to intended goals  
- Redefine/merge conceptual frameworks  

---

## **P3 — Evolution & Reconfiguration**
Improve or regenerate the entire cognitive structure.

Tasks:
- Recursive synthesis  
- Archive obsolete models  
- Validate new models via feedback or peer test  

---

# 🧬 Domain Logic

Ideal for:

- reflection loops  
- recursive training cycles  
- meta-analytic models  
- evaluation engines  

The refinement pass amplifies detail around:

- self-correction  
- model lineage  
- bias inspection  
- conceptual realignment
