# 🧠 Phase 1.2 — Entropy-Governed Recursion (Bounded Cognition)

## Overview
Phase 1.2 extends the sswg-mvm Optimization Engine into a **bounded-entropy cognition system**.
Recursion is no longer infinite—it is **governed by energy awareness** and **verifiable efficiency**.

## New Components

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ai_memory/entropy_controller.py` | Tracks cumulative entropy and halts recursion when the budget is exhausted. |
| `ai_evaluation/verity_tensor.py` | Produces a scalar verity score combining semantic, deterministic, and entropic dimensions. |
| `ai_memory/benchmark_evolution.py` | Logs verity/entropy/determinism trajectories to analyze convergence over time. |

## Conceptual Model

### The Verity Equation
\[
V = (S \times D \times (1 - E))^{1/3}
\]

- **S** = semantic clarity  
- **D** = deterministic stability  
- **E** = entropy magnitude  

Convergence occurs when the entropy gradient approaches zero while verity still rises.

---

## Cognitive Principle
> *"No thought shall consume more order than it creates."*

The system thus self-limits recursion by measuring how much clarity it buys per unit entropy.

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Controlled recursion depth based on entropy trend.
- Quantitative benchmark memory for long-term epistemic learning.
- Unified metric (Verity Tensor) to evaluate reasoning efficiency.

---

## Integration Plan (Next Phase)
1. Wire entropy controller into recursion manager.  
2. Record verity tensor each iteration in benchmark evolution.  
3. Visualize convergence curves in visualization subsystem.
