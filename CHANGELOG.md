# Changelog

This changelog tracks notable updates to the sswg-mvm repository. For run
instructions and canonical workflow guidance, refer to `docs/RUNBOOK.md`.

## [v1.2.0]

### Added
- Bounded cognition tooling: entropy controller, verity tensor, and benchmark evolution modules.
- Phase 1.2 overview documentation for entropy-governed recursion.
- Evolution bundle documenting the milestone lineage through v1.2.0.

### Updated
- Optimization-aware recursion and evaluation signals to align with entropy budgets and verity tracking.

### Detailed (v1.2.0 release)
- Introduced entropy governance terminology across overview, architecture, and subsystem documentation.
- Documented verity tensor evaluation axes (semantic, deterministic, entropic) and bounded cognition stop conditions.
- Expanded optimization subsystem guidance with ontology integration, telemetry schemas, and example outputs.
- Added memory and benchmark evolution notes for cognitive thermodynamic telemetry.

## [v1.1.0]

### Added
- Optimization subsystem with ontology-backed templates, schema, and loader.
- Throughput and epistemic optimization metrics for workflow evaluation.
- Cross-domain semantic mapping helpers and optimization telemetry logging.

## [v1.0.0]

### Added
- Stable mvm recursion, evaluation, memory, and export pipeline.
- CLI-integrated generation and validation workflows for reproducible artifacts.

## [v0.9.0]

### Added
- Schema governance and orchestrator modules that enforce deterministic validation.
- Module registry, dependency graph mapping, and anomaly detection tooling.

## [v0.5.0]

### Added
- Recursion manager, phase controller integration, and semantic evaluation metrics.
- Deterministic recursion depth management and schema validation before recursion.

## [v0.1.0]

### Added
- Canonical workflow and template schemas.
- Recursive template manifest and reflection-oriented template set.

## [v0.0.9mvm]

### Added
- Canonical PDL schemas and the 9-phase pipeline contracts under `schemas/` and `pdl/`.
- PDL validation tooling via `generator/pdl_validator.py` and the example PDL in `pdl/example_full_9_phase.yaml`.
- Audit bundle tooling, promotion readiness validation, and phase evidence bundles in `generator/` and `scripts/`.
- Governance, invariants, and execution policy documents (`governance.yaml`, `invariants.yaml`, `root_contract.yaml`).

### Updated
- Documentation coverage across `docs/` for architecture, recursion, metrics, telemetry, and runbooks.
- Determinism and reproducibility enforcement in generator utilities and audit gate scripts.

### Notes
- Pre-release licensing remains in effect. See `LICENSE.md` and `TERMS_OF_USE.md`.

## [v0.0.0]

### Added
- Conceptual groundwork for workflow-as-cognition and synthetic verity.
