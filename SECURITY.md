# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the default branch of this repository. Release
branches, if any, are supported only when explicitly labeled in release notes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following channels:

1. **Preferred:** Open a GitHub Security Advisory for this repository.
2. **If the issue is not sensitive:** Open a GitHub issue with a clear title and
   include the word "security".

When reporting, include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce, including relevant configuration or environment details.
- Any suggested remediation or mitigation.

## Disclosure expectations

- Do not publicly disclose security issues before maintainers confirm a fix.
- Follow coordinated disclosure timelines agreed upon in the advisory thread.
- Security changes must continue to respect sswg/mvm governance, determinism
  requirements, and validation gates defined in AGENTS.md and governance.yaml.
